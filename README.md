## Road lane detection and tracking system for autonomous vehicles

This system is able to detect and track road lanes in lighting conditions. Such as day time lighting conditions and night time lighting conditions.

System has two major components.

* Image classification component
* Image processing component

Functionalities of the mentioned components

Image classification component | Image processing component
------------------------------ | --------------------------
Classify the time of the day   | Extract the feature from the frame
Select thresholding values     | Calculate the results and merge results with the original frame

Output results

* Day time example
* Night time example
